### Project Description
our project involves developing a character and that dynamically combines with user provided input to make funny¬†responses

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wonder what it‚Äôs like to hear a cat complain about existential boredom, or a dragon grumble about dealing with annoying knights? This project tackles the ‚Äúpressing‚Äù problem of giving animals and mythical beings a voice to vent their unique life struggles.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre building a chatbot that brings out the inner gripes and quirks of animals and mythical beings, using AI to create wildly entertaining and character-driven complaints.
